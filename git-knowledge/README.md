# Useful `git` commands

## `git reset --hard`
* [My understanding] reset everything changed (*NOT* including untracked) and go back to `HEAD`.
* [Reference] https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset.
 
## `git branch -a` following by `git checkout *<the-specific-branch>*`
* [My understanding] switch to remote branch (usually a newly cloned repo) that is not existent yet in local repo.
