# General-CS-Knowledge
It is a toolbox for myself, that collects some *tiny pieces of wit* when I encountered some questions/problems and finally solved them successfully.

## Knowledge
* Theoretical and/or practicle knowledge about general computer science related topics, including but not limited to:
    * **Programming language**: e.g, C++ Knowledge [contained in `cpp-knowledge` folder]
    * **Useful tool**: e.g, Git Knowledge [contained in `git-knowledge` folder]
    * **Popular framework**: e,g, ROS Knowledge [contained in `ros-knowledge` folder]

## Software
* Installation and/or configuration for some important, sometimes even necessary, sofeware stacks. For right now, the part only contains links to the valuable websites that help solve the installation/configuration.
    * **OpenCV**: How to install [OpenCV 4.1.0](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/15/how-to-install-opencv-4-on-ubuntu/)
